# ros_followbot
My versions of Programming Robots with ROS examples from chapters 12-14.
This includes all of part III of the book (Perception and Behavior).
Besides followbot there is patrolbot and stockroombot.

NOTE: it is helpful to add this to your .bashrc (replace followbot with
the directory in which you cloned this repo):

alias sb='source ~/followbot/devel/setup.bash; \
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=${HOME}/followbot/src/stockroombot/models'
